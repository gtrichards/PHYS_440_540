We can train an autoencoder on the full data set, then used the encoder part as the base of a regular neural network that is trained on the labeled data that we do have. This is found to be a much more efficient way of initializing weights and biases than starting from random, because you are \"cheating\" a bit by already figuring out some of the data structure using the autoencoder.
