We will refer to $h(x)$ as the probability density (distribution) function or the \"**pdf**\" and $h(x)dx$ is the propobability of a value lying between $x$ and $x+dx$. A histogram is an example of a pdf.\n",
    "\n",
    "While $h(x)$ is the \"true\" distribution (or **population** pdf), what we *measure* from the data is the ***empirical*** distribution, which is denoted $f(x)$.  So, $f(x)$ is a *model* of $h(x)$.  In principle, with infinite data $f(x) \\rightarrow h(x)$, but in reality measurement errors keep this from being strictly true.\n",

    "If we are attempting to guess a *model* for $h(x)$, then the process is *parametric*.  With a model solution we can generate new (simulated) data that should mimic what we measure.  \n",

    "Our goal is ultimately to figure out the *distribution* from which our data is drawn, i.e., we want to know the *model*.  For example, let's say that we are trying to characterize the population of asteroids in the Solar System.  Maybe their sizes have a Gaussian distribution (with some characteristic size), or maybe they have a flat distribution (with equal numbers over a large range of sizes).  Or maybe the distribution is a power-law, with lots of little asteroids and very few big ones.  Or maybe it is a power-law in the other direction: very few little ones and lots of big ones.  If you are the first person to discover asteroids, then *you don't know*.  Our job is to figure that out: based entirely on the data."
