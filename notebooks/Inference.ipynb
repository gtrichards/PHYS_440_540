    "\n",
    "### The Principle of Indifference\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially this means adopting a uniform prior, though you have to be a bit careful.  Saying that an asteroid is equally likely to hit anywhere on the Earth is not the same as saying that all latitudes of impact are equally likely.  Assuming $1/6$ for a six-side die would be an example of indifference.\n",

    "### The Principle of Invariance (or Consistency)\n",
    "\n",
    "This applies to location and scale invariance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Location invariance** suggests a uniform prior, within the accepted bounds: $p(\\theta|I) \\propto 1/(\\theta_{max}-\\theta_{min})$ for $\\theta_{min} \\le \\theta \\le \\theta_{max}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Scale invariance** gives us priors that look like $p(\\theta|I) \\propto 1/\\theta$, which implies a uniform\n",
    "prior for ln($\\theta$), i.e. a prior that gives equal weight over many orders of magnitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Principle of Maximum Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of maximum entropy is discussed in Ivezic, 5.2.2.\n",
    "It is often true that Bayesian analysis and traditional MLE are essentially equivalent.  However, in some cases, considering the priors can have significant consequences. \n",
